One of the disadvantages of a micro-service architecture is the config situation. Say you have 15 micro-services. Then say want to make the same change in each one. Well, now you have the pleasure of opening 15 pull requests.

This is one of those weird tasks where the time it takes to automate the thing [outweighs](https://xkcd.com/1319/) the time it takes to do it manually.

[Partially](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/) scripting the task can help, though. I break it into 3 main parts:

1. Set main branch, feature branch, and commit message variables
1. Make a branch off your main branch
1. Make a checklist of things to change. Don't hold this info in your head, you're bound to forget something
1. Commit and push the changes. Git will output a pull request URL for you. Profit

```sh
export main_branch="master" && \
export feature_branch="some-name" && \
export commit_message="some message"

git checkout "${main_branch}" && \
git pull origin "${main_branch}" && \
git checkout -b "${feature_branch}"

# CHECKLIST
# thing 1
# thing 2
# ...

git add --all && \
git commit -m "${commit_message}" && \
git push --set-upstream origin "${feature_branch}"
```
